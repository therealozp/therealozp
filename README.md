# hello there ðŸ‘‹

(my boss calls me Bento)

i build stuff for fun. all of my projects are built in the spirit of âœ¨ fun âœ¨, and to learn more stuff to build more projects.

**Form follows function.**

## ðŸ”§ tools i use

I've been tinkering with:

- Programming Languages: Python, C and friends, JS and friends, Golang, and (begrudgingly learning) Rust.
- Frameworks and Libraries: React, Next, Express, PyTorch (and friends)
- Version Control: I only have one lover and it's `git` (but I am willing to fumble with Atlassian and BitBucket)

## ðŸ“« connect with me!

- Portfolio: [Here!](https://khangis.dev) (major overhaul done over the past couple months)
- LinkedIn: [Khang Le](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anhkhang-le/)
