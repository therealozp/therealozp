# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Khang!

(i definitely did **not** know you can do this on GitHub)

I love **AI** and all things _computer stuffs_. I've been developing a lot of websites both on the front- and back-end, and now I'm looking further to building systems and machine learning! 

## ðŸš€ Technologies and Tools

I've been tinkering with:

- Programming Languages: Python, C++ (and friends), JavaScript, SQL
- Frameworks and Libraries: React, Next, Express, PyTorch (and friends)
- Tools and Platforms: VSCode, GNU/Linux (and friends)
- Version Control: I only have one lover and it's `git`

## ðŸ‘¯ Looking to Collaborate

I'm always open to collaborating! If you're working on something cool, I'd love to help so feel free to reach out!
